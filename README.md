- **Modular design**: Easily extendable via components and views

*(Adjust this list based on your actual app functionality.)*

---

## Tech Stack

Built with modern web technologies:

- **TypeScript, React, Vite** – for a fast and type-safe frontend experience  
- Custom structure separating **components**, **contexts**, **hooks**, **utils**, and **views**  
- *(Add UI libraries, state management tools, or backend tech if applicable.)*

---

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/KuuSora/Farm-Ledger.git

## Usage

*(Describe the app’s functionality and how to use it—for example:)*

- **Logging activities**: Record planting, harvesting, expenses—navigate to “New Entry”  
- **Viewing reports**: Check dashboards, filter data by crop, date, or activity type  
- **Syncing data**: *(describe offline handling or export options here, if relevant)*

*(Customize this with your actual navigation paths, UI flow, or screenshots.)*

## Project Structure

```
/components   → Reusable UI components  
/context      → React context providers for global state  
/hooks        → Custom hooks (e.g., for data fetching or handling form state)  
/utils        → Utility functions/helpers  
/views        → Page components representing app screens/layouts
App.tsx       → Main React application root  
index.tsx     → ReactDOM entry point  
Vite config   → Build tool configuration
```

This organization keeps the code modular and maintainable.
